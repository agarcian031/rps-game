### Overview: 

This is a recreation and simple implementation of the grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. The previous project found in a [different repo](https://github.com/agarcian031/rock-paper-scissors) was the game from the browser window. This version focuses more on front-end implementation and an attempt at cleaner code as mentioned in [this lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/clean-code).
